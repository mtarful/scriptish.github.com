Well it sounds like [electrolysis](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis) (e10s)
may be
going by the wayside in Fennec 12, and never make it in to Firefox after all
of those firefox developers telling addon developers to write e10s friendly code,
and even forcing us to implement it in order to adopt Fennec.  Which [I happily
did](http://scriptish.org/news/2011/09/05/scriptish-supports-fennec.html) not
long ago.

Now addon developers are being told that better performance gains can be had by
focusing efforts in other directions (and that is probably the case), so e10s
may be at best, put on hold.

So I'd like to make a plea for electrolysis; performance wasn't the
only benefit as I recall, security was a benefit, and the ability to kill
long running processes was another, and I do want those benefits!

I want control even more than some performance gains.

If you agree then please make some noise.

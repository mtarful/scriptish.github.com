[Scriptify](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scriptify) is a add-on created by [Kris Maglione](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/1300653/)
which allows users to easily package a user script in to a restartless add-on.
The add-on works fine alongside Scriptish or Greasemonkey.

The add-ons which Scriptify creates can then be uploaded to AMO, where it can be reviewed.  If
you are familiar with the old [user script compiler](https://arantius.com/misc/greasemonkey/script-compiler),
which did something similiar, then you will want to defamiliarize yourself.

Big thanks to Kris for developing this add-on, it is a big step forward for the
community!

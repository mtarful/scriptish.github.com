Like so many features in Scriptish, this was another feature that I had tried
very hard to get in to Greasemonkey, because it was a feature that felt I had to have,
in fact it's a feature that I had desperately wanted ever since I started using
user scripts back in 2005.  So a couple of years ago when I had just started
digging in to the Greasemonkey code and learning about Firefox extension
development, [sizzlemctwizzle](https://github.com/sizzlemctwizzle) and I got
started on a branch to implement user script updating for Greasemonkey.

Then when enough features I wanted piled up that weren't making in to
Greasemonkey, I finally decided to fork Greasemonkey and make Scriptish, and
this was one of the first features that I merged.

So Scriptish became the first user script engine to natively support
user script updating.

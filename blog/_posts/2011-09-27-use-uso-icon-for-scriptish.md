I found a neat userstyle that will use the [Userscripts.org (USO)](http://userscripts.org/)
icon instead of
the Scriptish icon for the toolbar button and in a few other places (almost
everywhere the Scriptish icon is used).  I figure that some users will like
this because I had a few requests for a icon that would look better with a
black background for the addon bar.

[So check this userstyle out!](http://userstyles.org/styles/53817/scriptish-use-userscripts-org-icon-everywhere)

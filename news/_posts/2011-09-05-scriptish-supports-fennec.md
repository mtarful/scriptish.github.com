Well I don't know about you, but ever since I got a Android with Fennec
installed I've been itching to have user scripts on my
cell phone like a fiend, so the last couple of weeks I devoted all of my
free time (that I didn't spend playing Halo) working on getting Scriptish to
support Fennec.  Now I can finally say that
**Scriptish 0.1.5 supports Fennec!!**

The main challenge supporting Fennec was that it uses
[e10s](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/e10s)
which didn't have much useful documentation I found, so I had to find some time
to build example addons to try out what was possible.  I'll probably write some
tutorials on [my blog](http://erikvold.com/) in the near future if you are
interested in that sort of thing.

Scriptish 0.1.5 was just uploaded to AMO, so it should be reviewed within a
week or so.

I hope you enjoy user scripting the mobile web!

I decided to move the issues tracker for Scriptish from Github to
[Lighthouse](http://lighthouseapp.com/).

The Github API is fantastic I have to
say, and I was able to easily export the issues, and it would be a simple task
to import the issues back into Github (authorship would be lost, but it could be
maintained either by obtaining the req'd authorization info or adding text to the
body of a comment/issue mentioning the original author).  However, there are
also many problems that I have with the Github issue tracker, and most
of them boil down to being about either missing features or broken features.

So, I decided to make the switch to Lighthouse, and to demonstrate
why I think it is the better issue tracker, here are some features that
Lighthouse has which Github issues do not (which cannot be said vice versa):

* RSS feeds for issues.
* Pages for the issue tracker.
* Priority property for issues.
* Default text for issues (which greatly improves the quality of bug reports!).
* Tag cloud.
* Better search and filters.
* More states than just 'open' and 'closed'.
* I can create a separate issue tracker for the block list.

So if you are looking for the new issue tracker, then you can find it here:

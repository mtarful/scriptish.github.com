I should have done this a long time ago, because the advantages are so great,
such as writing code that others can reuse for their addons, security!, and
much greater operability.

I created a [userscripts package](https://github.com/scriptish/userscripts-jetpack-package)
a while back, which was a good start, but there is a long ways to go still!

I will be reporting on my progress.
